# Get some vitamin D

The same application as described [here](https://github.com/barnabasmolnar/vitamin-d).
The difference being that the rendering here is done on the client with the popular React js library as opposed to server side rendering with jinja templates. Flask here is merely used as an API server that returns json responses.

### Technologies used:
* Python
* Flask
* Client side rendering with React
* Docker for development and to containerize the app

### SVGs used:
* [Zondicons - A set of free premium SVG icons. By Steve Schoger](http://www.zondicons.com/)

Instructions to install and run the app will follow shortly...

### TODO:
* [ ] Add detailed instructions to README
* [ ] Add purgeCSS + additional npm scripts
* [ ] Look into dockerizing the frontend build process
* [ ] Tidy up the structure a bit perhaps? Add a component folder, create a helpers/utilites file and move some stuff there, extract SVG icons into their own components, etc... that sort of stuff. With this being a relatively small-scale project, I don't really feel this would be a must but if I do have some time, I might get around to it eventually.

### DONE
* [x] Animations added
